<h1>What is Healthy Skin?</h1>
<p>Healthy skin is characterized by a smooth and glowing skin.<br> It has one even color, isn't blotchy, is well hydrated, doesn't feel<br> flaky or tight, has a smooth texture, and is free of acne.<br>
However, air pollution, UVA radiation, organic pollutants, PAH,<br> smoke, soaps, etc. are constantly damaging your skin.<br>
These aggressors cause most of the commonly seen skin issues, such <br> as uneven skin-tone, dryness, pimples and many other skin ailments</p>

 <h2> Why Is Healthy Skin Hard To Maintain?</h2>
<p>Since your skin is unique, you need a skin care regimen that's tailored to your skin's <br> unique characteristics. What's more,<br> your skin's characteristics change with time and are themselves contingent on multiple factors.

<h3>The Weather</h3>
Where You Live<br>
Your Daily Skin Care Routine<br>
Your Age, etc.<br>
As the above factors don't remain constant, neither does your skin and its unique requirements</p>
